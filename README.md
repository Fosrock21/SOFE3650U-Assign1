# Grocery Store Product Management

This repository contains a Java project for managing products in a grocery store using the Abstract Factory and Factory Method design patterns. The project is structured as follows:

## Folders

### `src` Folder

The `src` (source code) folder contains the Java source code for the grocery store product management system. It includes the following packages and classes:

  - `GroceryProductFactory`: An interface for creating grocery products.
  - `BananaFactory`: A concrete factory for creating Banana products.
  - `AppleFactory`: A concrete factory for creating Apple products.
  - `GroceryProduct`: An interface for grocery products with a `setPrice()` method.
  - `Banana`: A concrete class representing Banana products.
  - `Apple`: A concrete class representing Apple products.

The main package that contains the `GroceryStore` class, which serves as a test driver for the system.

### `data` Folder

The `data` folder contains text files that store product prices. For this assignment, there are two files:
- `bananas.txt`: Stores the prices of Bananas.
- `apples.txt`: Stores the prices of Apples.

## Test Methods

The repository includes a comprehensive set of test methods within the `GroceryStoreTest` class to verify the functionality of the grocery store product management system. Screenshots of the test results can be found in the `screenshots` folder.

## Screenshots

The `screenshots` folder contains screenshots of the test results executed. These screenshots demonstrate the successful execution of various test cases (diffrent prices).
